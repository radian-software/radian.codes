## Radian LLC privacy policy

At present I do not have a formal privacy policy written up because
none of the services I maintain process or retain anyone's personal
information. If you need to know something specific about privacy
practices please reach out at `privacy@radian.codes`.

Privacy information for specific projects is also available:

### Note on legal communications

The following informational notice appears on all communications with
`legal@radian.codes`:

> Privacy notice: Transparency is a core value of Radian LLC and we
> believe that all business and legal communications should be able to
> withstand public scrutiny. For this reason, all communications with
> Radian LLC are retained and may be disclosed with third parties or
> the general public, unless otherwise specified in writing by Radian
> LLC. By sending any form of communication to Radian LLC, you are
> providing your consent, and/or consent on behalf of your
> employer(s), to disclosure of such communication without limitation,
> and certifying that you have the authority to provide such consent,
> to the extent permissible by law in the state of California. If you
> need to communicate information which should not be shared
> externally, please request this ahead of time, in writing. If you
> have not received written notice from Radian LLC of an exception to
> this policy, then you should assume all communications may be
> shared.

The intent of this policy is to disincentivize the use of legal
communications for threats and blackmail, as has occurred [in the
past](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/), and it will not
be used outside of those situations.
