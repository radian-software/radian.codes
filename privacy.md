## Radian LLC privacy policy

At present I do not have a formal privacy policy written up because
none of the services I maintain process or retain anyone's personal
information. If you need to know something specific about privacy
practices please reach out at `privacy@radian.codes`.

Privacy information for specific projects is also available:

* <https://github.com/radian-software/hypercast#privacy-statement>

### Note on legal communications

The following informational notice appears on all communications with
`legal@radian.codes`:

> CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: By contacting this address you consented to
> the unlimited reproduction and publication of your current and
> future correspondence, as was documented in our privacy policy. This
> policy applies irrespective of any notice or request in your
> communication.

The intent of this policy is to disincentivize the use of legal
communications for threats and blackmail, as has occurred [in the
past](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/), and it will not
be used outside of those situations.
